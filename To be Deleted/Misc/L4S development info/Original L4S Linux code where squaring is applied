The squaring of the classic probability in the code is done in the function `dualpi2_classic_marking`. Specifically, the probability is squared in the line:

```c
if (dualpi2_roll(prob) && dualpi2_roll(prob)) {
```

Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

1. **Function `dualpi2_classic_marking`:**
   This function is responsible for determining whether a packet in the classic queue should be marked or dropped based on the computed probability.

2. **Squaring of the Probability:**
   ```c
   if (dualpi2_roll(prob) && dualpi2_roll(prob)) {
   ```
   This line calls `dualpi2_roll(prob)` twice, and both conditions need to be true for the `if` statement to execute its block. The `dualpi2_roll` function returns `true` with a probability of `prob / MAX_PROB`. By calling it twice, the overall probability becomes `(prob / MAX_PROB) * (prob / MAX_PROB)`, effectively squaring the probability.

Here's the relevant part of the function:

```c
static bool dualpi2_classic_marking(struct dualpi2_sched_data *q,
                                    struct sk_buff *skb, u32 prob,
                                    bool overload)
{
    if (dualpi2_roll(prob) && dualpi2_roll(prob)) {
        if (overload || dualpi2_skb_cb(skb)->ect == INET_ECN_NOT_ECT)
            return true;
        dualpi2_mark(q, skb);
    }
    return false;
}
```

In this function:
- `dualpi2_roll(prob)` is called twice within the same `if` statement.
- If both calls return `true`, the condition `dualpi2_roll(prob) && dualpi2_roll(prob)` evaluates to `true`.
- This results in the probability of marking or dropping a packet being the square of the original probability (`prob`).
